Our intention is to make aim42 freely available for everyone, in any private or commercial setup.
We only require you to give us credit.


# Our License
All of the aim42 work is published under the liberal [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license. That means, you're completely free to:


* **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
* **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

 The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.


## But...

To use this material:

* You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use (**Attribution**).

* If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original (**ShareAlike**).


The last sentence (sharealike) means, that any improvements or suggestions you make for the aim42 method or website needs to be published under
the same license.

Of course, the systems you apply aim42 to (that is, your software!) can always remain private!
