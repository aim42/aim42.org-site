##  I'm Gernot Starke.

As [innoQ-Fellow](https://innoq.com) and practical software- and architecture practitioner
I support organizations of various domains in improving their software.

Apart from optimizing _time-to-market_, I focus on reducing maintenance- and operational costs,
facilitating team collaboration and development efficiency.

I help to effectively and efficiently architect and develop new IT systems
and bring them into production.

After graduating in computer science at Aachen University of Technology and a few years
or practical experience, I wrote my PhD thesis on software engineering (at J.Kepler
  University in Linz, Austria, with Prof. Chroust). People call me _practical and pragmatic methodologist_ - with geek genes...

I've published a number of technical books, mostly on software architecture,
patterns, development processes and software documentation.

In 2005 I (co-)founded and still actively maintain [arc42](http://arc42.de),
the free portal for software architecture and documentation, together with its
international companion [arc42.org](http://arc42.org).

In 2014 I founded [aim42](http://aim42.org), the „Architecture Improvement Method“
(aim42.org).

I'm founding member of [iSAQB](https://isaqb.org), currently in the position of working
group lead for the CPSA-Foundation Level. I successfully trained literally thousands
of developers in software architecture topics.

Together with my wife Uli and our awesome kids we live in beautiful Cologne.
