    title: "Iterative improvement in phases"
    excerpt: 'aim42 works iteratively in three phases (analyze, evaluate, improve) supported by crosscutting activities. For each phase, aim42 proposes a number of proven and established practices and patterns. aim42 is **free and open-source**, completely **vendor-agnostic** and does not require any specific tool. '


feature_analyze:
      - image_path: /images/analyze-phase.png
        alt: "Analyze"
        title: "Analyze: Identify issues and improvements"
        excerpt: 'In the analyze-phase you obtain detailed understanding of the system and systematically identify issues, risks within the system and its environment. Additionally, you develop ideas for improvements.'

feature_evaluate:
      - image_path: /images/evaluate-phase.png
        alt: "Evaluate"
        title: "Evaluate: How grave are the issues?"
        excerpt: 'Estimate the **value** of issues (how serious they
        might be) and the required **effort** for potential improvements.
        Estimation often results in intervalls [high, low].'

feature_improve:
   - image_path: /images/improve-phase.png
     alt: "Improve"
     title: "Improve: Apply or perform selected improvements"
     excerpt: 'Perform changes in code, architecture, environment or associated processes.
     Distinguish between short-term (tactical) **practices** or long-term (strategic) **approaches**. aim42 collects dozens of proven practices and examples of such improvements.'

feature_crosscutting:
   - image_path: /images/crosscutting-phase.png
     alt: "Crosscutting"
     title: "Crosscutting: Manage and plan"
     excerpt: 'Manage relationships between issues and improvements, maintain issue list and improvement backlog.'
